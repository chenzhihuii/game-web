# game-web
A web-based version of the classic 2048 game. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, encapsulating the game logic within a single JavaScript file. To ensure consistent deployment across environments, I containerized the application using Docker, allowing it to run seamlessly on Ubuntu systems.
